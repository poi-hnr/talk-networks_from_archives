	abstract = {Language has been viewed as a window on the mind. Language is also a window on culture. Through analyzing texts the interplay between human cognition and culture can be examined. Through analyzing texts cognitive similarities and differences across individuals, which serve as a basis for culture can be described. Through analyzing texts the impact of culture on individual behavior can be examined. In addition, such analyses can locate similarities and differences across cultures and changes within cultures. This paper explores the relative benefits for using content analysis and map analysis for extracting and analyzing culture given a series of texts. Content analysis has been the traditional textual analysis method used for examining culture. However, it is not theoretically grounded. In contrast, map analysis has received less use and is theoretically grounded in an understanding of human cognition. It is shown that under certain conditions map analysis subsumes content analysis. Researchers can thus use map analysis not only to extract and analyze culture but to examine the relationship between cognition and culture. Illustrative applications are drawn from four different studies.},

	abstract = {Founded in 1922 by the League of Nations upon observation that the pacification of Europe may benefit from a better collaboration between scientific elites, the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation (ICIC) is responsible for coordinating the restructuration of knowledge circulation. Bringing together leading researchers at the height of their career, such as Albert Einstein, Marie Curie and George Hale, chaired by Henri Bergson, the Committee weaves a complex network between transnational scientific institutions and societies, congresses and individuals (Pernet 2014). 
This paper proposes an analysis of the work and functioning of the organization between 1919 and 1927 by setting up a database containing metadata of thousands of documents contained by the ICIC funds (United Nations Archives, Geneva). Visualized as a network of 3.200 people (tens of thousands of relationships), this work provides a new understanding of the internal organization of the Intellectual Cooperation, as well as completely new insights about its relations with the rest of the scientific and diplomatic world. In particular, we will show the necessity to compare the “micro” structure of relationships as mapped by the archive with the “macro” formal structure of the institution. Do the thousands of documents, in a distant reading approach (Moretti 2013), confirm the internal organization of the League of Nations or do they show individuals/communities that bypass the official hierarchy? 
As an opening to an epistemological debate, this research questions the relationship between the researcher, the database and its sources: are the metadata of an archive corpus usable information, regardless of their unique qualitative content? More technically, it also addresses the issue of data visualization and modeling in the historical sciences.},

The project uses data from the Biography Portal of the Netherlands (BPN), which contains approximately 125,000 biographies from a variety of Dutch biographical dictionaries from the eighteenth century until now, describing around 76,000 individuals. BiographyNet's aim is to strengthen the value of the portal and comparable biographical datasets for historical research, by improving the search options and the presentation of its outcome, with a historically justified NLP pipeline that works through a user evaluated demonstrator. The project's main target group are professional historians.

We suggest that data structures produced during the analysis of a DCH corpus, might better be modeled as a set of inter-related graphs and subgraphs, that together form a “multilayer graph”, a concept recently defined within the field of complex systems. We consider some existing visualization approaches that may be suitable for visualizing and analyzing DCH data within a multilayer graph visual analytics system. We examine how to build a multilayer graph data set from DCH data. We also describe an initial set of tasks, based on interviews and discuss how we will use the expertise of professional researchers in the field of DCH to evaluate and validate our design decisions made as part of our research.},

	shorttitle = {Multimode and {Multilevel}},
	abstract = {In the field of global history, especially when it comes to « histoire croisee », the use of metaphors describing the vertical organization of a society, its structuration into layers or into overlapping systems, is common. The temptation to use a second metaphor, calling everything a “network”, is also very important in this domain, whose objects of study are often transnational organizations with multiple branches, intertwined within umbrella organizations, sharing board members and including several levels of secretariats and subcommittees. However, the use of these images is not limited to historical studies, since we use the same vocabulary in other disciplines to describe social situations or textual structures. 
When we go beyond the metaphor to develop a formal analysis, we often produce multigraphs who, because they simultaneously express horizontal and vertical relationships, are generally unsuitable for the analysis (and visualisation, except in very simple cases). If the “exploratory” dimension of social network analysis – and especially the fact that its display is relatively subjective – is often a subject of criticism, we propose here to play with the visual representation to show precisely how an original modelling can improve the reading of complex graphs, and helping to restore a “morphological” information where disorder seems to prevail. 
Based on two examples from archives mapping and theatre character networks, this paper proposes a reflection on the different ways to take account of verticality in graphs. In particular, we are developing a way to impose a macro-structure to a network, allowing a two-dimensions view that reflects the hierarchical affiliations of its components. We will see that this method, by constructing a stable visual representation in time and space, helps to compare different types of relationships and/or different time states of the graph.},

	title = {Entity-{Centric} {Text} {Mining} for {Historical} {Documents}},
	abstract = {Recent years have seen an important increase of digitization projects in the cultural heritage domain. As a result, growing efforts have been directed towards the study of natural language processing technologies that support research in the humanities. This thesis is a contribution to the study and development of new text mining strategies that allow a better exploration of contemporary history collections from an entity-centric perspective. In particular, this thesis focuses on the challenging problems of disambiguating two specific kinds of named entities: toponyms and person names. They are approached as two clearly differentiated tasks, each of which exploiting the inherent characteristics that are associated to each kind of named entity. 
 
Finding the correct referent of a toponym is a challenging task, and this difficulty is even more pronounced in the historical domain, as it is not uncommon that places change their names over time. The method proposed in this thesis to disambiguate toponyms, GeoSem, is especially suited to work with collections of historical texts. It is a weakly-supervised model that combines the strengths of both toponym resolution and entity linking approaches by exploiting both geographic and semantic features. In order to do so, the method makes use of a knowledge base built using Wikipedia as a basis and complemented with additional knowledge from GeoNames. The method has been tested on a historical toponym resolution benchmark dataset in English and improved on the state of the art. Furthermore, five datasets of historical news in German and Dutch have been created from scratch and annotated. The method proposed in this thesis performs significantly better on them than two out-of-the-box state-of-the-art entity linking methods when only locations are considered for evaluation. 
 
Person names are likewise highly ambiguous. This thesis introduces a novel method for disambiguating person names from news articles. The method, SNcomp, exploits the relation between the ambiguity of a person name and the number of entities referred to by it. Modeled as a clustering problem in which the number of target entities is unknown, the method dynamically adapts its clustering strategy to the most suitable configuration for each person name depending on how common this name is. SNcomp has a strong focus on social relations and returns sets of automatically created social networks of disambiguated person entities extracted from the texts. The performance of the method has been tested on three person name disambiguation benchmark datasets in two different languages and is on par with the state of the art reported for one of the datasets, while using less specific resources. 
 
This thesis contributes to the fields of natural language processing and digital humanities. Information about entities and their relations is often crucial for historical research. Both methods introduced in this thesis have been designed and developed with the goal of assisting historians in delving into large collections of unstructured text and exploring them through the locations and the people that are mentioned in them.},

@inproceedings{grandjean_translating_2019,
	title = {Translating {Networks}: {Assessing} correspondence between network visualisation and analytics},
	shorttitle = {Translating {Networks}},
	abstract = {Network interpretation is a widespread practice in the digital humanities, and its exercise is surprisingly flexible. While there is now a wide variety of uses in different fields from social network analysis to the study of document circulation metadata or literature and linguistic data, many projects highlight the difficulty of bringing graph theory and their discipline into dialogue. Fortunately, the development of accessible software, followed by new interfaces, sometimes with an educational dimension, has been accompanied in recent years by a critical reflection on our practices, particularly with regard to visualisation. Yet, it often focuses on technical aspects.
In this paper, we propose to shift this emphasis and address the question of the researcher’s interpretative journey from visualisation to metrics resulting from the network structure. Often addressed in relation to graphical representation, when it is not used only as an illustration, the subjectivity of translation is all the more important when it comes to interpreting structural metrics. But these two things are closely related. To separate metrics from visualisation would be to forget that two historical examples of network representation, Euler (1736) and Moreno (1934), are not limited to a graphic reading (the term “network” itself would only appear in 1954 in Barnes’ work). In the first case, the demonstration was based on a degree centrality measurement whereas in the second case the author made the difference between “stars” and “unchosen” individuals while qualifying the edges as inbound and outbound relationships.
This is why this paper propose to examine the practice of visual reading and metrics-based analysis in a correspondence table that clarifies the subjectivity of the translation while presenting possible and generic interpretation scenarios.},

Word embeddings represent semantic relations between words as relationships between vectors in a high-dimensional space, specifying a relational model of meaning consistent with contemporary theories of culture. Dimensions induced by word differences (rich – poor) in these spaces correspond to dimensions of cultural meaning, and the projection of words onto these dimensions reflects widely shared associations, which we validate with surveys. Analyzing text from millions of books published over 100 years, we show that the markers of class continuously shifted amidst the economic transformations of the twentieth century, yet the basic cultural dimensions of class remained remarkably stable. The notable exception is education, which became tightly linked to affluence independent of its association with cultivated taste.},

Specifically, the structure of focused face-to-face interaction constrains chance expectations for power relations. Power is constrained to equalize (by change alone) as interaction sequences increase in length. Power is constrained to polarize (by chance alone) as group size increases. Since interaction sequences falling within the operative range of human perception as specified by Miller (1956) and Simon (1974) are relatively short, power will be increasingly concentrated as a function of group size in most situations, yielding Michels's law and Mosca's proposition. As these regularities hold at much smaller sizes than originally specified by Michels (1911), their implications for macro-level control structures are examined in light of the results. It is concluded that control structures at the macro level are likely to be affected by considerations above and beyond those imposed by face-to-face (micro-level) interaction.},

Interpretations usually do not take into account the intense political agitation of the previous decades, which already involved lower class participation, and they fail to recognise the major socio-economic differences between the areas touched by the revolt. The main arguments are, first, that the struggle for Independence in Maranhao, more violent than in most other provinces, opened the door to lower class involvement in politics under liberal leadership. Secondly, the struggle between local elites for regional power led to exclusion of peripheral elites within the province and fuelled lower class unrest. Significant moments of rupture between liberal leadership and popular movement occurred as early as 1823-4 and 1831-2. Thirdly, the main structural factor leading to the 1838 outbreak of rebellion was the resistance to military recruitment by the free lower classes, which provided a unifying slogan to otherwise heterogeneous groups of peasants, cowboys, and fishermen. Fourthly, the differences in social structure between the cattle producing South, the cotton plantation belt of the Itapecuru valley and the strong subsistence sector in Eastern Maranhao account for substantial differences in terms of support and leadership during the Balaiada. Whilst fazendeiros lead the struggle in Southern Maranhao, as well as in most of the neighbouring Piaui province, leadership in Eastern Maranhao was almost entirely of lower class origin. Finally, the dynamics of the movement could lead in Eastern Maranhao to a rupture with elite liberalism and envisage the alliance between free rebels and maroons.},

Recently, differing visions on the importance of business networks have arisen. In the case of Mexico, the literature argues that entrepreneurs relied heavily on an informal institutional structure to obtain necessary resources and information. In contrast, the recent historiography of Brazil suggests that after 1890 the network of corporate relations became less important for entrepreneurs trying to obtain capital and concessions, once the institutions promoted financial markets and easy entry for new businesses. Did entrepreneurs in Brazil and Mexico organize their networks differently to deal with the different institutional settings? We examine whether in Mexico businessmen relied more on networks of interlocking boards of directors and other informal arrangements to do business than in Brazil. Our hypothesis is confirmed by three related results: (1) the total number of connections (i.e., the density of the network) was higher in Mexico than Brazil; (2) in Mexico, there was one dense core network, while in Brazil we find fairly dispersed clusters of corporate board interlocks; and most importantly, (3) politicians played a more important role in the Mexican network of corporate directors than their counterparts in Brazil. Interestingly, even though Brazil and Mexico relied on very different institutional structures, both countries had similar rates of growth between 1890 and 1913. However, the dense and exclusive Mexican network might have ended up increasing the social and political tensions that led to the Mexican Revolution (1910—1920).},

	abstract = {This article applies network analysis tools to letters written by and about English Benedictine nuns living in Brussels during the seventeenth century in order to demonstrate the ways in which such an approach expands our picture of early modern religious communities, makes visible the protagonists of religious controversy, and advances debates about enclosure and anonymity. The dataset for this network analysis is taken from the RECIRC project database (the project is entitled “The Reception and Circulation of Early Modern Women’s Writing, 1550-1700” http://recirc.nuigalway.ie/). The RECIRC project is producing a large-scale quantitative analysis of the ways in which women’s writing was received and circulated in the early modern English-speaking world; its database will be open-access from the project’s close. The project has captured reception data on a range of female-authored sources, including texts produced in English convents established in Europe during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The metadata extracted from the nuns’ letters that form the basis of this study have generated 1,188 reception records, each tracing a connection between a female author and a receiver. Network analysis is shown here to illuminate debates about the nature and extent of enclosure imposed upon early modern nuns, as well as the sheer breadth and diversity of their epistolary relationships. Furthermore, it exposes otherwise invisible protagonists in religious controversy, and progresses methodological debates about the presentation of data relating to anonymity.},

patronage letters, showing how they actively constructed their social networks and
presented credible portraits of themselves through a host of conversational and
discursive techniques that appear with marked regularity in thousands of letters. It
offers to sociologists of culture a set of concepts borrowed (in part) from discourse
analysis, concepts that help transcend the divide between self-interest-based and
structural position-based explanations of ‘networking.’ It analyzes the social history
of the key Renaissance concept of honor, and describes how this strategic
interaction impinged on the development of the Florentine state and on modern
constructions of the self.},
