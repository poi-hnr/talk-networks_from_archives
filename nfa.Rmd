# Historiographical debate

Two theories/approaches:

- **Metropole-periphery dependence** `r Citep(bib, c("prado_colonial_1967", "novais_portugal_1995"))`
    - PE as a hierarchical system of political and economic dependencies between the Crown and the colonies

- **Multi-continental monarchy** `r Citep(bib, c("fragoso_monarquia_2009", "fragoso_um_2017"))`
    - PE as a complex interplay of political, economic, administrative, and social **networks**.
    - Local elites vis a vis the Crown

Questions:

- Who are the key actors?
- What are the relevant types of relationships?
- How these networks look like?
- How these networks over the years?


???

- Negotation/cooperation vs competition between local elites and the crown

To this end

- Reconstruct networks of administrative correspondence using data on 170'000 documents exchanged in the period 1610 - 1833 deposited at Historical Overseas Archives of Lisbon


---



# Goals

- Report how we used modern tools of Natural Language Processing to extract structured data from otherwise unstructured free text
- Present preliminary descriptive analysis of the created data

---
